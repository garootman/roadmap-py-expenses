# roadmap-py-expenses


Build a simple expense tracker application to manage your finances. The application should allow users to add, delete, and view their expenses. The application should also provide a summary of the expenses.

Application should run from the command line and should have the following features:
- Users can add an expense with a description and amount.
- Users can update an expense.
- Users can delete an expense.
- Users can view all expenses.
- Users can view a summary of all expenses.
- Users can view a summary of expenses for a specific month (of current year).

## Usage
```bash
$ expense-tracker add --description "Lunch" --amount 20
# Expense added successfully (ID: 1)

$ expense-tracker add --description "Dinner" --amount 10
# Expense added successfully (ID: 2)

$ expense-tracker list
# ID  Date       Description  Amount
# 1   2024-08-06  Lunch        $20
# 2   2024-08-06  Dinner       $10
